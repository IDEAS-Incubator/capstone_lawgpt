# LawGPT Implementation Guide

This guide outlines the key components students should implement for the LawGPT project.

## 1. Authentication System

Students should implement:
- User registration with password hashing (don't store plaintext passwords)
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role-based access control

Example implementation for `auth.py`:
```python
# Implement JWT token generation
# Implement user authentication
# Implement password hashing
```

## 2. RAG System Implementation

The core of the project is the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system:

1. Document processing:
   - Split documents into chunks
   - Generate embeddings for each chunk
   - Store in Qdrant with metadata

2. Query processing:
   - Generate embeddings for user query
   - Retrieve relevant document chunks
   - Format prompt with retrieved context
   - Send to LLM for response generation

Example implementation for `rag_service.py`:
```python
# Implement document retrieval
# Implement context enrichment
# Implement response generation with sources
```

## 3. Database Integration

MongoDB will store:
- User information
- Conversation history

Qdrant will store:
- Document embeddings
- Document metadata

Example implementation for database connections:
```python
# Initialize MongoDB connection
# Initialize Qdrant connection
# Implement CRUD operations
```

## 4. API Endpoints

Key endpoints to implement:
- `/register`: User registration
- `/token`: Authentication
- `/query`: Process legal queries
- `/ingest`: Document ingestion

## 5. LLM Integration

Students should implement:
- Connection to Groq/LLAMA for inference
- Prompt engineering for legal context
- Response parsing and formatting

Example implementation:
```python
# Connect to LLM API
# Format prompt with context
# Parse and structure response
```

## 6. Document Ingestion Pipeline

Students should implement:
1. Document parsing and cleaning
2. Chunking strategy for legal documents
3. Embedding generation with OLLAMA
4. Storage in vector database

## 7. Deployment Preparation

Prepare for deployment:
- Containerization with Docker
- Environment variable configuration
- Process management with PM2
- Logging implementation
